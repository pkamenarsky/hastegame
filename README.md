# Haste

Basically, the aim of this project is to resurrect the legendary speed-running tournaments (like the cult Quake done Quick movie) using modern graphics technology and somewhat improved gameplay specifically designed for the needs of speed-running.

We are using our own stand-alone renderer (originally written by Carlos Rafail Giani), but since we have a tight timeframe, we decided to use the famous Quake3 BSP file format in order to be able to benefit from the widely used map editing tools.
Somewhen in the next few weeks we will release a playable version with per-pixel lighting, shadowmapping, relief mapping (conestep mapping), fog and transparency, and further on perturbed EMBM water.

We decided to integrate a physics engine as well (Newton) in order to emphasize the important role of game speed dynamics.This project is not meant to be distributed commercially, the reasons being the tight timeframe, the intended public, as well as the possibility of being a portfolio of the participants.

Moreover, we'd need some additional help in order to make this game greater and a worthy replacement for all the speed runners out there.
