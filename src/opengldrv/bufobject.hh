//! This class handles OpenGL 1.4 vertex buffer objects.
/*!
A vertex buffer object (VBO) is an OpenGL structure capable of storing
geometry data in video- and AGP-RAM. Hardware T&L performance is excellent
with VBOs, so they are chosen instead of vertex arrays and display lists.
Contrary to its name, a VBO can store both vertices and indices, the first one
being an array buffer, and the latter one an element array buffer.
	
\warning Always call the bind() method at least once before (un)mapping,
creating or deleting the VBO. Otherwise, the wrong VBO might be affected, or an
access violation may occur.

	values are:\n

	at most a few times as the source of a GL (drawing) command.\n
	\n
    <b>STREAM_READ_ARB</b>\n
	The data store contents will be specified once by reading data from the GL,
	and queried at most a few times by the application.\n

    <b>STREAM_COPY_ARB</b>\n
	The data store contents will be specified once by reading data from the GL,
	and used at most a few times as the source of a GL (drawing) command.\n

	The data store contents will be specified once by the application, and used
	many times as the source for GL (drawing) commands.\n

    <b>STATIC_READ_ARB</b>\n
	The data store contents will be specified once by reading data from the GL,
	and queried many times by the application. \n
	\n
    <b>STATIC_COPY_ARB</b>\n
	The data store contents will be specified once by reading data from the GL,
	and used many times as the source for GL (drawing) commands.\n
	\n
    <b>DYNAMIC_DRAW_ARB</b>\n
	The data store contents will be respecified repeatedly by the application,
	and used many times as the source for GL (drawing) commands.\n
