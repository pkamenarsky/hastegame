	//! Base class for reference counted objects.
	/**
	* This implements the classic approach to reference counting.
	* It also inherits its main weakness: circular references. Unfortunately, boost::shared_ptr
	* has serious DLL problems, making it useless in cross-DLL environments.
	* This class contains a reference counter, which is incremented with addRef().
	* To decrement it, release() is called, and when the counter reaches zero, release() destroys
	* the object.
	*
	* The initial reference count is zero.
	* Example usage:
	*
	* @code
	* RefCounted *pRefcountedObj=someResourceManager->resource("res1"); // InsomeResourceManager->resource(), addRef() is called
	* ....
	* pRefcountedObj->release(); // Decrements the reference count. If this was the only reference, the count becomes zero, and the object is deallocated
	* @endcode
	*
	* Additionally, a pointer to a refcount manager is stored in RefCounted. If this pointer points to a RefcountedManager
	* instance, the destructor calls this instance, notifying it from the RefCounted instance's destruction. This is useful for
	* resource management; the resource manager is also the refcount manager. If one of the resources is destroyed, the resource
	* manager is notified, thus giving it a chance to erase the resource from its list of active resources.
